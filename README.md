# RISC-V Disassembler

This is a simple RISC-V disassembler made in C++.
Currently the I, M, A, F, D, Q, Zicsr, and Zfencei instruction extensions are supported.

Upcoming is support for the C extension and file format parsing for ELF and PE files in order to make the disassembler a bit more accessible.

Work on more efficient code and structure will be done at some point in time.
