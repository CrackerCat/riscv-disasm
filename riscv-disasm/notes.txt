* Type of instruction is opcode dependent -> can further simplify that way, parse it, and then do instruction detection

Be careful with extensions, there is a lot of bullshit going on there

> Implement RV32I, RV64I, RV128I, Zifencei, Zicsr, Counters First, (PRIMARY FOCUS ON BASE INTEGER INSTRUCTIONS FIRST, AKA FIRST FOUR)
> Then implement all the other extensions
