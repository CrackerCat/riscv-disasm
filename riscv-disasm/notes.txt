* Type of instruction is opcode dependent -> can further simplify that way, parse it, and then do instruction detection

Be careful with extensions, there is a lot of bullshit going on there
>need unique parsing routines for that

>After imlpementing all available extensions provided by hte manual, look into working with compressed instructions (See "C" extension in the manual)
>Need to fix load instructions to do load a, offset(b) instead of load a, b, offset
>Fix use of rs1 and rs2 in S-type instructions
